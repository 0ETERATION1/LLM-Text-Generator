# Project Name

## Overview

This project is designed to leverage OpenAI's GPT models for a variety of tasks including text summarization and chat completion, alongside web scraping functionalities. It features a modular architecture that includes a Flutter-based web application, Python backend services, and a set of utilities for processing and summarizing text. 

## Directory Structure

- `README.md`: The project's main documentation file.
- `config/`: Contains configuration files, such as `prompt_templates.json` for storing templates used by the summarizer.
- `flutter_web/`: The Flutter project for the web application. It includes directories for various platforms (`android`, `ios`, `linux`, `macos`, `web`, `windows`) and the main Dart code in `lib/`.
- `src/`: The Python backend source code.
  - `interfaces/`: Defines CLI interfaces for interaction with the backend functionalities.
  - `python_backend/`: Contains core functionalities including:
    - `controller.py`: Coordinates calls to different backend services.
    - `distribution.py`: Manages the distribution of tasks within the backend.
    - `preprocessor.py`: Preprocesses text data before it is fed into summarization or other processing tasks.
    - `summarizer.py`: Summarizes text using OpenAI's GPT models.
  - `scrapers/`: Contains web scraping utilities.
  - `utils/`: Miscellaneous utility functions and classes.
- `static/`: Static files for the web application, such as logos.
- `tests/`: Contains test scripts for the backend functionalities.

## Key Components

### Flutter Web Application

- Located under `flutter_web/`, it serves as the frontend of the project, allowing users to interact with the summarization and text processing features through a web interface.

### Python Backend

- **Summarization**: The `summarizer.py` module uses OpenAI's GPT models to generate summaries of input text. It utilizes templates defined in `config/prompt_templates.json` for structured output.
- **Web Scraping**: The `scrapers/` directory contains modules like `pdf_scraper.py` and `web_scraper.py` for extracting text from PDFs and web pages, respectively.
- **Utilities**: The `utils/` directory offers support functionalities used across the project.

### Tests

- The `tests/` directory ensures the reliability of the backend functionalities through unit tests, including tests for the summarizer and scraper modules.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup Virtual Environment**: It's recommended to use a virtual environment for Python dependencies.
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Flask Backend** (Ensure the working directory is the project root):
   ```sh
   export FLASK_APP=src/main.py  # Set environment variable
   flask run  # Start the Flask application
   ```
4. **Build and Run the Flutter Web Application**:
   ```sh
   cd flutter_web
   flutter pub get
   flutter run -d chrome  # Launches the app in Chrome
   ```
